# retrofit2 apigen

Generate some basic API documentation from retrofit2 annotations.

## Setup

Compile with gradle somehow. Probably clean build.

## Usage

`apigen.jar <path_to_srcdir1> <optional_path_to_srcdir2> <etc>`

## TODO

`https://square.github.io/retrofit/2.x/retrofit/` 
Only the methods and some of the annotation types are supported, the rest can be added somewhat easily with additional support for multi-argument annotations
